        <p> Jacqueline Julianna Butzinger is a composer, sound director & creative technologist working in the fields of 
            electroacoustic and experimental music. She explores the intersection of sound and technology, creating multi-channel sound pieces, 
            installations and performances, often utilizing self-built electronics and hybrid electro-acoustic instrumental setups.
        </p>

        <p> As a composer, Jacqueline is deeply interested in alternate tuning systems, interferences, 
            and pattern-based algorithmic processes. Her work spans from purely synthetic pieces, using sine waves and noise, 
            to complex hybrids of acoustic and electronic elements. 
            She is particularly drawn to the spatiality and physicality of sound, often designing systems that allow sound to move and shift within a physical space.

        </p>
        <p> Collaboration plays a key role in Jacqueline’s practice, and she often works with dancers, choreographers, 
            and other artists to develop interactive systems 
            that enhance the embodied experience of sound. Whether through wearable speaker backpacks or custom instruments, 
            Jacqueline’s projects invite exploration and interaction, allowing technology to not only extend musical expression but also reshape how we experience sound in space.
        </p>
        <p> She holds a Bachelors Degree in Musikinformatics from the Music Conservatory in Karlsruhe and a Masters Degree in electroacoustic composition from School of Music Hanns Eisler in Berlin. 
            Her work has been performed at the ZKM Karlsruhe, the Beethoven Festival in Bonn, Freerotation Festival, Klangwerkstatt Festival in Berlin and the Academy of the Arts in Berlin.
